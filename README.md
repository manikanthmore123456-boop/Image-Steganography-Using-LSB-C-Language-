# Image-Steganography-Using-LSB-C-Language-
This project implements image steganography using Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique in C. It securely hides secret data inside 24-bit BMP images with minimal visual distortion. The application supports encoding and decoding via CLI, uses magic string verification, and demonstrates bitwise operations, file handling, and system-level programming.
